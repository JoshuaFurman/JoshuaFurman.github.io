### Its about time I made a blog 

I've thought about creating a blog for some time now and I think it's high time I finally do. I will use this space to write about just about anything I find interesting and just so happens I find quite a lot interesting. So this should be fun. I dont expect anyone else to read my posts let alone take interest so this will always be for myself.

### A little bit about the picture above:

The picture at the top of this page is from one of my favorite painters, (I dont really care much for paintings but I enjoy this style) Pieter Brueghel the Elder. He was a Dutch painter from the 1500's. He's unique for his time as the landscape style wasn't popular and a majority of his paintings depict peasants or the lower class. 

The painting above is: [Netherlandish Proverbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlandish_Proverbs)
